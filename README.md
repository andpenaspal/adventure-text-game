# The Project

This project aims to develop an `Adventure Text Game Creator`. The application will allow users to create their own `Adventure Text Game`.

An `Adventure Text Game` is composed by a set of `Cards` linked to each other that allow the user to follow a story. Each `Card` shows a piece of narrative `Content` and offers different `Options` for the user to chose from, the decision affects the `Flow` of the story. Based on the the decision, the story will advance following different `Flows`, with different developments and endings for each of the `Flows`.

## Iterations

1. Adventure Text Game Interface:
   - The user can interact and play a story.
   - Story stored in a JSON.
   - No BE.

This will be reused in the future as a previewer for the Creator Mode and to play stories. This will feed the research into the DB structure.

2. Adventure Text Game Creator:
   - The user can create his/her own story.
   - The user can preview the story.

# Technology
